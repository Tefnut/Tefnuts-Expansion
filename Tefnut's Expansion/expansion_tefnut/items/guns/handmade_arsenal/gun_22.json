    "description": "This handmade .22 lead spewer has a unique double-barrel design which allows it to fire faster than even the American 180. Dispersion and durability take a hit, but this will still work incredibly well, especially mounted on a vehicle. The twin barrels are inside a cooling sleeve, basically negating the tiny amount of heat produced by the small round. It can be fired unmounted, as well, through a conviniently detachable rifle grip, but its big and bulky.",
